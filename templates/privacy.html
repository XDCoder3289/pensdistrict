    <article class="article">
      <p>Our business is based around the trust of our readers. We want to be transparent in what we do and how we earn money as a company.</p>
      <p>We earn money on this site through:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Affiliate commissions</li>
        <li>Partnerships with advertisers</li>
      </ul>
      <p><em>We participate in affiliate programs, including (but not limited to) Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn commissions by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated
          sites</em>. All of the products for which we receive affiliate commissions are ones that we believe in, and in many cases, have used ourselves.</p>
      <p>In the case of advertising partnerships, we only agree to a partnership if we believe in the product and the company itself.</p>
      <p>We will display disclaimers on all sponsored content. We may also include, in certain areas, more explanation defining sponsored content to readers. In addition, we will ensure the treatment and design of advertising and sponsored content
        are clearly separate from our editorial content.</p>
      <p>We may reject or remove any sponsored content at any time that contains false, deceptive, potentially misleading, or illegal content; or is inconsistent with or may tend to bring disparagement, harm to reputation, or other damage to the
        PensDistrict brand and its websites.</p>
